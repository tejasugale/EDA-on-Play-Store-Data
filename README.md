Exploratory Data Analysis on Play Store Data

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a statistical method for investigating data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA is an essential first step in any data analysis project, as it helps to understand the data and identify any potential problems.

The goal of EDA is to gain a better understanding of the data by exploring its properties. This can be done by looking at the data's distribution, its central tendency, its variability, and its relationships between variables. EDA can also be used to identify outliers, missing values, and other problems with the data.

EDA is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used with a wide variety of data sets.

Benefits of EDA

EDA offers a number of benefits, including:

Better understanding of the data: EDA can help you to understand the data's main characteristics, such as its distribution, its central tendency, and its variability. This understanding can help you to make better decisions about how to analyze the data.

Identification of problems: EDA can help you to identify problems with the data, such as outliers, missing values, and errors. This can help you to correct the data before you start your analysis.

Data reduction: EDA can help you to reduce the size of your data set by identifying patterns and relationships. This can make it easier to analyze the data and identify trends.

Data visualization: EDA can help you to visualize the data in a way that makes it easier to understand. This can be helpful for communicating the results of your analysis to others.
